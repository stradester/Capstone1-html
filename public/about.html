  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Arizona, USA.  The only time I lived outside Arizona 
    (or the US for that matter) was when I served a two-year proselyting mission for 
    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  I came home from my mision in 
    Jan 1994 and attended Mesa Community College where I met my lovely wife, Christine.
  </p>
  <p>
    We dated for three months   before we got engaged in April 1995.  We were married 
    in July 1995 in the Mesa, Arizona temple.  Christine and I were still going to school
    (me to be a Civil Engineer and her to be an Accountant).  I was working for my dad at 
    Automated Mortagage Credit Reporting (AMCR) back when loan officers needed to obtain 
    mortgage credit reports from a 3rd party vendor.  Christine was working for an accounting 
    firm.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1996, we had our first child, Danielle (Dani).  She was a welcome addition to our family.  
    A couple of years later (2 1/2 to be exact), our second child was born, Riley.  
    Around the time Riley turned 1, we bought our first house.  This was just before the Y2K
    scare.  I mention this because my dad sold his business because of the Y2K scare and I lost 
    my job.  We were struggling to make ends meet.

    I love movies!  I love knowing who the main actors and actresses are, who directed them,
    who scored the movie, when they came out, etc.  I also had a decent collection of movies
    on VHS and wanted to catalog them somehow.  One day prior to losing my job, I happened 
    upon a program called Microsoft Access and I had no idea what it was.  Since the internet 
    at this point in time was virtually non-existent, it was difficult to gather any relevant 
    information about things.  However, from what I could cobble together from Microsoft's "not 
    online" help pages, I figured out that it was a relational database management system 
    that could, among other things, catalog my movies.  I would be able to see what movies I 
    had by year, title, length, or anything.  I would be able to see how many movies I had from 
    a specific genre, or how many movies I had where Harrison Ford was the star, as an example.
  </p>
  <p>I was so excited!  So, I started learning everything I could about it.  I even bought 
    a book about how to program in MS Access using VBA (that's what you had to do back then 
    if you wanted to learn something).  I was telling a close friend of mine about my 
    accomplishments and he mentioned that the company he worked for had an MS Access database 
    that needed to be updated and automated and asked if I was interested.  Absolutely!  I did 
    contract work for the company that employed him and I loved it.  They seemed to really 
    appreciate the work I did, they liked the questions I asked, the design features I 
    implemented, and the overall ease of use after I was done.  That contract work helped me and 
    my family until I was able to get a job as a Civil Engineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I finished my education in Civil Engineering and started down that career path after I 
    graduated from Arizona State University in Dec 2001.  The day after I graduated, our third 
    child, Brittney, was born.  She was actually born on my birthday -- well, her birthday 
    now.  Throughout my career in Civil Engineering, I was employed by a couple of different 
    engineering firms and there were some opportunities to develop or enhance existing MS 
    Access databases utilized by those firms.  I loved their excitement when they found out 
    I could help them and I loved that I had an opportunity to work on an MS Access app.

    In 2003, our next child, Cameron, was introduced to our lives.  He was born with Down 
    Syndrome.  We knew very little about this genetic disorder but jumped in with both feet 
    to learn.  He was a very happy baby, and to this day, is still a very happy person.  But, 
    he had a lot of health challenges that delayed his development, which is typical for a 
    person with Down Syndrome.  For instance, he has had cataract surger and open heart surgery, 
    to name a few.  He was a challenge to raise but he was and is very rewarding.  
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2007, our final child, David, was born.  He was born the day before Independence 
    Day.  As he grew, he would do amazing things like crawl around 6 months and walk around 
    12 months.  Of course, this was amazing to us because Cameron had not developed so quickly,
    so to us, David was a genius.  However, since he was a 5th child, there were a lot of 
    siblings around to coddle them -- and they did!  He could have walked much sooner, but 
    he could convince his siblings to carry him everywhere.  He didn't have to speak because 
    he could grunt and point just like his older brother, Cameron, and his siblings would jump 
    up and get whatever he wanted.  He was a lot of fun.
  </p>
    After working as a Civil Engineer for about 6 years, I was hired on by my client, Roosevelt 
    Water Conservation District (RWCD), as their resident engineer.  One of the managers at 
    RWCD was an Electrical Engineer by education and had developed a CRM with MS Access.  I was 
    excited to find out that they used MS Access and went to work developing other Access apps 
    to streamline processes and get away from pencil and paper.  I developed a scheduling app 
    for the Water Dept. to manage water delivery schedules.  I developed an app to track 
    construction plan reviews that were submitted to RWCD for review to determine if a utility 
    crossing or a developer or municipality wanted to relocate RWCD facilities.  I developed 
    an HR app to track employees' PTO, wages, etc.  I developed an app to digitize all of 
    RWCD's customer files, receipts, invoices, Board of Directors meeting minutes, and just 
    about anything else you could imagine.  I was in heaven!
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2016, I contracted a web developer to develop RWCD's website to allow our customers 
    to place a water order, see their scheduled water time, put money in their water account, 
    view their account statement, etc.  This required RWCD's data to be migrated to something 
    other than MS Access so that it could be used as the backend for the website and to be 
    scalable.  We decided on Microsoft SQL Server.  I was amazed at how much more it could do 
    than MS Access.  I was hooked again!  I migrated all of our data to SQL Server.  I then 
    had to adjust all of the remaining MS Access front end apps to use SQL Server as the 
    backend.  It was a relatively smooth transition.
  </p>
  <p>
    I finally realized that I should probably rip the bandaid off and learn how to be a 
    full stack web developer so that I could make web apps for me and others.  I had so many 
    great ideas but never had the tools to do it.  I am now on that journey with 
    <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy.com</a> and am very excited.  I very much 
    appreciate Christine and her support of me as I embark on this new path.  Gratefully, 
    I am still gainfully employed while I pursue this new endeavor.  There's no doubt I'm an 
    old dog, but I definitely know how to learn new tricks!
